<br><div identifier='1' id='2' uploaded_by='Jasmine Stoy' class='thread_div'><span style="color: gray; margin-left: 20px;">Response:</span><a class='delete' style='float: right;' href='javascript:void(0);'>Delete</a><div class="forum_post" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black;">Video Response to TED Talk:<br /><br />This TED Talk discussed the process of good ideas and the misconception regarding how they are formed. Steven Johnson began by discussing the importance of coffee shops and how they were an incubator of spawning new ideas. They were significant because they provided a place where people could discuss. Johnson then goes into detail about how people have a common misconception that &acirc;Äúthe great idea&acirc;Äù is just a flash of genius and happens in an instant, when in actuality, ideas are developed overtime through careful adaptation and most often, collaboration. Personally, this video changed the way I view entrepreneurship; I was always telling people that I see myself becoming an entrepreneur but &acirc;ÄúI can&acirc;Äôt say that because to be an entrepreneur, you need a new idea, which I don&acirc;Äôt have.&acirc;Äù I was always thinking that I can&acirc;Äôt call myself an entrepreneur unless I had that idea. From this video, I now see that I can&acirc;Äôt just expect for the great idea to come to me; instead I should be constantly innovating and evaluating problems and how I can fix them with entrepreneurial solutions.<br /> <br />Response to &acirc;ÄúHow to Win Friends and Influence People&acirc;Äù: <br /><br />In this first chapter of &acirc;ÄúHow to Win Friends and Influence People,&acirc;Äù Dale Carnegie talks about how people should not &acirc;Äúcriticize, condemn, or complain.&acirc;Äù This chapter of the book made me think about how little a negative attitude contributes to an entrepreneur&acirc;Äôs life. When people are too critical of themselves, they become timid and less inclined to contribute their ideas at the fear of them looking &acirc;Äústupid&acirc;Äù or inferior to others. I say this because I often held this kind of negative mindset throughout high school; I was less willing to take risks when it came to committing myself to activities and pursuing ideas. I also find myself frequently complaining about things I don&acirc;Äôt like instead of actively trying to find a way to fix the problem. <br /><br />Response to &acirc;Äú4 Hour Workweek&acirc;Äù: <br /><br />The first chapter of this book begins by comparing two forms of thinking and how they approach the similar situation. One type of person is known as the &acirc;Äúdeferrer&acirc;Äù and the other type is the &acirc;Äúnew rich.&acirc;Äù The Deferrers seem to be the ones that live their life very typically, to the book, and just go through the motions of performing certain activities, whereas the New Rich thinks of new ways to approach old problems; they find the motivations in doing things an try to live their life with a purpose. This makes me think that the New Rich mentality is the right way to go about doing business not only because it is more optimistic, but also because it makes work seem more enjoyable. The second chapter of this book basically lists a few golden rules that include not following what&acirc;Äôs popular, emphasizing strengths, and that things become excess in their opposite. I really enjoyed this chapter because it made me realize how very simple changes in my mindset can make a huge difference on productivity the way I approach problems. <br /><br><br><br><span>Posted by <b>Jasmine Stoy</b> on Tue, Sep 25 12:06:21 am</span></div></div>
<br><div identifier='1' id='3' uploaded_by='Anant Agarwal' class='thread_div'><span style="color: gray; margin-left: 20px;">Response:</span><a class='delete' style='float: right;' href='javascript:void(0);'>Delete</a><div class="forum_post" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black;">Response to TED Talk:<br /><br />    The concept of  an idea is very dynamic. Where are these ideas born and how do they originate? These questions are common among most human minds today. The role of a 3rd party in an idea&acirc;Äôs formation is eminent. The coffee house is the birthplace to many ideas. Taking the British setting as an example, it&acirc;Äôs evident as to when a society switches from a depressant(alcohol) to a stimulant(coffee), the horizon and power of thinking is broadened. An idea may be a light bulb moment or an eureka moment or an epiphany, such as Isaac Newton who discovered gravity. But, an idea is essentially a network, a closely knit connection of threads, something similar to the brain cells, the neurons. They pass stimuli, in response to the outer world happenings, which then lead to idea creation. But, then again, closed innovative systems, that is keeping an idea to yourself, prohibits growth. Let&acirc;Äôs take the GPS as an example for this. The only reason GPS transformed from data collection to Cold War planning to now finding a coffee house, is because of open innovative systems. It&acirc;Äôs evident as to how chance does favour the connected mind in most cases. The presence of an open platform, enables entrepreneurs to channelise their ideas into an enterprise.    <br /><br /> Response to &acirc;ÄòHow To Win Friends And Influence People&acirc;Äô:   <br />    <br />    I always wondered how the analogy of apples and oranges was employed in the real world. Timothy Ferriss employed this metaphor to draw a contrast, between the New Rich and the Deferrers. Largely, I learned that being a member of the New Rich category empowers you to do what you want to do and when you want to do. It implies something a bit more liberal and free.  Possession of wealth and usage of wealth are independent happenings. Anyone who follows the principles of doing what he or she wants to do and dreams of doing can become a member of the New Rich. Dale Begg-Smith and Julie epitomise the previous made statement. In any task, there are as always, 2 sides to the coin. You can play the game or you can beat the game. The key is, beating the game, not playing it. Bending the rules or playing outside the rulebook isn&acirc;Äôt unethical, just a different approach. Such guts are those, which entrepreneurs should have. Adhering by the rulebook may seem the &acirc;Äòethically appropriate&acirc;Äô way to approach life. But, having the foresight to look beyond the rulebook is the key element for success. Challenging the daily norms is essential, but not to the extent of appearing stupid. Principles to follow range from retirement not being an option to distress begin bad and healthy role models being good.<br /><br /> Response to &acirc;Äò4 Hours Workweek&acirc;Äô:   <br />    <br />    In complete agreement with Dale Carengie, I do believe that critisism isn&acirc;Äôt the way to handle people. Scorning and scolding people just strains relationships with them. Critisism leads to justification, which, in turn, leads nowhere in the long run. Even the worst of criminals such as &acirc;ÄòTwo Gun&acirc;Äô Crowley, Al  Capone and Dutch Schultz justify all their wrong doings. Critisisms and complaints just make things more complicated. Politics highlights this fact through the cases of Thomas Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. A great leader, Abraham Lincoln, learned how undue and excessive critisism, can have impregnable consequences. Learning from his errors, he preached against the principles of critisism and became a renowned leader. The relationship between a parent and a child, too, should be devoid of undue complaints and critique. Understanding that critisising people for their wrong doings is a linchpin of a business model. The communication techniques of empathy and persuasion are essential. Knowing that critisism leads to irrational justification is a must. Then and only then, will a prospective leader be born and will achieve some sufficient progress.<br /><br><br><br><span>Posted by <b>Anant Agarwal</b> on Tue, Sep 25 04:49:24 pm</span></div></div>
<br><div identifier='1' id='4' uploaded_by='Sean Yao' class='thread_div'><span style="color: gray; margin-left: 20px;">Response:</span><a class='delete' style='float: right;' href='javascript:void(0);'>Delete</a><div class="forum_post" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black;">Response to TED Talk:<br /><br />I strongly agree with the idea that network is the fundamental for birth of new ideas. Network can mean many things; network of ideas, people, resources, etc. My math teacher in high school used quote Steve Jobs&acirc;Äô famous line, &acirc;Äúconnect the dots&acirc;Äù. To approach problems that you never encountered, according to my math teacher need to connect the theories you learnt before to think new way to approach. It is the network of ideas that bring to new ideas, and story about Darwin&acirc;Äôs breakthrough in his study is the typical example for that principle. Ideas are not free. It is impossible for Newton to think about gravity solely by an apple falling down without his understanding of the nature. I do not believe that ideas suddenly &acirc;Äúpop up&acirc;Äù. Whatever seemingly unrelated events and experiences can lead to new ideas. I really like the story that Steve Jobs could make such beautiful fonts in Mac because he took calligraphy class in his college. Calligraphy and computer, Steve Jobs connected the two totally unrelated things, and it was a brilliant &acirc;Äúidea&acirc;Äù. <br /> Network of information can also mean network of people. The video talks about how coffee shop provided space for experts in different areas to share their ideas and led to enlightenment. I tend to be selfish about my own ideas. I&acirc;Äôm afraid if my ideas can be stolen and others can gain credit from them. I should change my attitude about sharing ideas. I do believe people can enrich each other&acirc;Äôs ideas by providing more aspects that a person can never think of. <br />  Lastly, I learnt that you need to be patient for new ideas. Nurturing idea is necessary. But also you should not give up thinking because you cannot come up with good ideas. Darwin could make his breakthrough because he did not give up thinking about it. So, right now, I should not give up thinking about what events should Gammas organize even though I don&acirc;Äôt have any good ideas!<br /><br />Response to &acirc;ÄòHow To Win Friends And Influence People&acirc;Äô: <br /><br />&acirc;ÄúDon&acirc;Äôt criticize, condemn or complain.&acirc;Äù <br />This is certainly not easy principle to follow because people are bad at suppressing their anger and desire to criticize others. By releasing our emotion and attacking others, we can gain temporary &acirc;Äújoy&acirc;Äù of being the one with authority because we tend to think people who criticize others are better and correct. <br />I have similar experiences in my clubs, too. Since I was the leader of the group, my decision was the most influential one and, I&acirc;Äôm ashamed to admit, I thought my decisions were better and well-thought than others. Leading an organization, I was always frustrated that people are not working as efficiently as I could be. I did not offend and criticize anybody like Lincoln and those writers in the book, but sometimes I could not suppress my complaints. That was really bad habit of me thinking I&acirc;Äôm better than the others. Telling people that &acirc;Äúyou are wrong and my way is more efficient&acirc;Äù is not only meaningless but much more harmful. Unfortunately, or it was fortunate because I might have made more mistakes later on, one day one of my club members finally cried out because of my criticism. It was accumulation of  dissatisfied feeling and discouragement from me that resulted in his sudden explosion. It was the most important lesson to me. Treat others as treasure, especially if you want to work with them well. Entrepreneurs are not only handling machines and technologies. Human capital is crucial to the success of the team. Treating others well, encouraging people, and working happily together can lead to incredible results. I love the story about how Hoover treats the mechanic who made a huge mistake. Not only Hoover gave the mechanic a chance to make up, but also a chance to grow. It is very important for the organization to let people learn from mistakes and grow. Most importantly, Hoover gained loyalty from the mechanic who will never ever make such a mistake to endanger his life. It was the best decision he could have made. Criticism can lead to a loss, but encouragement to learn from mistake can be so beneficial. <br />I want to clarify my own understanding about criticism. It&acirc;Äôs written as something we need to shun completely in the book, but I believe it depends on how you use it. Drug can be used to kill but also to cure. I think it&acirc;Äôs also a mistake you avoid criticism completely. Criticizing others for you own satisfaction, however, must be avoided.<br /><br />Response to &acirc;Äò4 Hours Workweek&acirc;Äô: <br /><br />During I was reading this book, I felt that I read pretty similar books before. I have read several books about Steve Jobs (I&acirc;Äôm a big fan of Apple), Ray Kroc (the founder of McDonald&acirc;Äôs), and various stories about successful entrepreneurs. The main concept that all of them share is to follow your passion and do not be blind of short-term economic satisfaction. Passion is essentially the most fundamental and the strongest drive for your actions. There will be lots of difficulties to encounter on your path to your goal, but if you have passion in what you are doing, you can keep going on your track.<br />In our society, many things are defined pretty solidly. Success means you are rich. Happiness means you are rich. Being busy and filled with work means you are rich! It is very easy for us to fall in this trap and pursue success and happiness which are defined by others, or society. It is typical that people will be less sensitive and passionate after following the rules set by others for years. <br /> I like one of the principles in the book that you have to work efficiently and set your own rules to follow. I think I have a trouble that assumes I can&acirc;Äôt do that and that because it is not usual or none of others does so. It is my biggest shortcoming that I assume too much. After reading several books, I found that successful people(NR) are those who are good at discovering shortcuts. One of the first lessons learnt in SEP pledge meeting is also about &acirc;Äúbe resourceful&acirc;Äù. I think I need to be more flexible in mind.<br /><br /><br><br><br><span>Posted by <b>Sean Yao</b> on Tue, Sep 25 05:05:47 pm</span></div></div>
<br><div identifier='1' id='5' uploaded_by='Tom Yet' class='thread_div'><span style="color: gray; margin-left: 20px;">Response:</span><a class='delete' style='float: right;' href='javascript:void(0);'>Delete</a><div class="forum_post" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black;">TED Video: Steven Johnson:<br /><br />I believe that there is usually an optimum method to go about doing most things, and it is therefore encouraging to hear that Steven Johnson&acirc;Äôs work provides evidence that this also exists for the process of creating ideas. Some of his findings are not too surprising &acirc;Äì such as the fact that the creation of ideas is most prolific in situations where people get together to bounce ideas off one another. Tying this back into my motivations for pledging with Sigma Eta Pi, I feel that a creative community as such is one of the key things I hope to benefit from, and I definitely hope that this will lead to not just the creation of some pretty good ideas, but also the inculcation of creativity as a way of life. Steven Johnson&acirc;Äôs talk also illuminates a second key point that the solutions to some problems are usually best solved by solutions which are readily accessible to us. When dealing with entrepreneurship, I feel that one oftentimes feels the need to create completely unique ideas using revolutionary technology or distinctively new methods just for the sake of fulfilling the idea of &acirc;Äúbeing truly entrepreneurial&acirc;Äù. The video thus serves as a stark reminder that some solutions are just within our vicinity. <br /><br /><br />&acirc;ÄúThe 4 hour work week&acirc;Äù:<br /><br />One of the key ideas of the book which appealed to me was the notion that I can decide my own purpose in life and set my goals accordingly, and that there is a way to balance it all. However, whenever the virtues of pragmatism are brought into discussion, its potential interference with a certain code of ethics must also be considered. I did gain some refreshing insights from the two short chapters, such as the idea that &acirc;Äúless is not laziness&acirc;Äù or the idea that &acirc;Äúthe timing is never right&acirc;Äù. However, I feel it might be wise to recommend any readers of a pragmatism-touting book to keep in mind the distinction between the character ethic and the personality ethic (borrowing terms from Stephen Covey&acirc;Äôs 7 Habits). The latter tends to sway to the end of the spectrum of pragmatism and is therefore characteristic of business-world mentalities. However, we must still hold true to the set of values which determine our character, and polish whatever is inside of us for that is who we truly are. In our culturally globalized world it is understandably important to create a personality for ourselves which hides the flaws of our characters and accentuates strengths we never truly have, but in the context of a larger issue (also talked about in this book) of determining the fundamental things in life which make us contented people, let us uphold a stoic integrity to the truth of who we really are deep inside.<br /><br /><br />&acirc;ÄúHow to win friends and influence people&acirc;Äù<br /><br />To be fair to the author, I have but read just a portion of the entire book. However, I believe criticism is a more complicated matter than was illustrated in Chapter 1. Yes, I definitely believe in the demerits of criticism &acirc;Äì it is mostly unhealthy for emotional relationships (and by emotional I mean relationships which involve any kind of human emotion, ie. All relationships). I believe that criticism engenders animosity and establishes a kind of in-your-face situational hierarchy between 2 people which I personally dislike to create. Criticism, in the sense illustrated in Chapter 1, is futile because there are other more constructive ways of motivating change in others. In this respect, I definitely agree with the gist of Chapter 1&acirc;Äôs message. However, I don&acirc;Äôt necessarily believe that &acirc;Äúpeople do not blame themselves 99% of the time&acirc;Äù (quoting the book) and by this logic I believe that constructive criticism can sometimes be the most effective way in driving across the message that a certain someone needs to get his act going. That being said, I believe it is usually impossible to completely put oneself in another&acirc;Äôs shoes, and therefore criticism in any case should never be an instinctive or reactive, but should be deliberated. I have heard of this book before; I never read it, but the title seemed to suggest that it contained an algorithm for somehow &acirc;Äúengineering&acirc;Äù the acquirement of friends. This chapter, however, changed such an impression that I had and the subtle theme of &acirc;Äúunderstand others before oneself&acirc;Äù has definitely captured my attention. I will try to give the rest of the book a good read.<br /><br><br><br><span>Posted by <b>Tom Yet</b> on Tue, Sep 25 05:39:03 pm</span></div></div>

Your ideas are living things; they grow and evolve over time.  Ideas are born out of chaos, one idea leads to a new idea which leads to a new idea. I can think of no better environment than SEP for this to occur. The speaker talked about the liquid network, where ideas flow, clash, change and eventually that leads to great ideas and great innovation. This liquid network has to be diverse, different backgrounds and perspectives. Progress is about connecting people&acirc;Äôs ideas and hunches. We need to focus on connecting, sharing our ideas rather than be afraid that someone might steal our brilliant idea. &acirc;ÄúChance favors the connected mind&acirc;Äù<br />How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;&acirc;Äô<br />People care about their pride. This pride makes people defensive when attacked. Criticism is dangerous, not only is it ineffective, it often creates resentment. Criticism often does not help because people will justify their actions to themselves to avoid feeling wrong or at fault. In order to create compliance, one must forgo the condemning of others and work to positively enforce good behavior in order to see long term change. People are not always logical, we are driven by our emotions, and we need to remember this when dealing with others. It&acirc;Äôs easy for us to criticize others, to condemn their actions, it takes true strength to be calm headed and understanding of each unique situation. <br />The 4 Hour Work Week&quot;<br />Society has told us since birth that you will grow up, work, pay taxes and die. You may start a company you may just be an employee, but you do all this for security. The security that you will be accepted by your peers that you will gain respect in their eyes if you can provide for your family, buy a house etc. We have been living our lives subject to the values that may not be our own. We have one life to live, so why waste it trying to please others. However, understanding that people desire security, people will work for that paycheck gives one the ability to take advantage of this desire and have others do the work for you. Retirement should never be the goal if you are doing something you are passionate about. If retirement becomes a goal, you should maybe re-evaluate. <br /><br><br><br><span>Posted by <b>Alex Akiyama</b> on Tue, Sep 25 05:46:51 pm</span></div></div>

In today&acirc;Äôs world, we often use descriptors such as &acirc;Äúflash&acirc;Äù, &acirc;Äústroke&acirc;Äù, and &acirc;Äúlight bulb&acirc;Äù to describe a good idea. To Johnson, an idea is the product of a network of neurons. We generate good ideas by getting our brain into an environment that is suitable for the formation of such a network. An environment that leads to innovation is a place that fosters the jostling of ideas everywhere -- it is not a place for &acirc;Äúalone moments&acirc;Äù. Ideas grow and develop in the back of our minds gradually; they do not often occur to us as &acirc;Äúepiphanies&acirc;Äù. We have to bring ideas out by being in the right environment. We should strive to connect ideas rather than worry about protecting them. Steven Johnson&acirc;Äôs TED talk relates well to us as college students. Here we are in an intellectual space that has the potential to encourage the &acirc;Äújostling of ideas&acirc;Äù. Regardless of whether we really do possess innovation and direction at this point in our lives, it is nevertheless critical that we start building that network of neurons. And the first building block we might set down is simply by being with the right people and putting ourselves in the right situations.<br /><br />&quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;<br /><br />I think we often underestimate the power of human relations and the role it plays in the quality of our everyday lives. Having left those middle school years behind us, we may think that the popularity game has finally ended. But as we become more mature, we start to realize that the game has only manifested itself more in our lives. Social skills have become something more than a systematic generator of new Facebook friend requests. A specific trait of people who know how to work with others is the ability to rethink their own criticisms and complaints. Having read the first chapter of How to Win Friends and Influence People, I feel very inspired by its various anecdotes. I hope to retain its ultimate lesson next time I find myself in a difficult situation: Don&acirc;Äôt criticize, condemn or complain.<br /><br />&quot;4 Hour Work Week&quot;<br /><br />A fundamental difference between the New Rich (NR) and the Deferrers is their ultimate end goal. While the NR believes in living in and enjoying the process toward their life philosophy, the Deferrers live for the attainment of the ultimate goal. In these first two chapters of the book, three key concepts resonated especially strongly with me. First, &acirc;ÄúInterest and energy are cyclical.&acirc;Äù It suggests that instead of seeing retirement as the final goal in life, rotate the pattern of your lifestyle between hard, passionate work and experiences you&acirc;Äôve never dreamed of living -- or &acirc;Äúmini-retirements.&acirc;Äù I find this concept especially appealing because I&acirc;Äôve never been able to understood people who are able to work 9-5 every single day, 5 days a week. I do not believe that humans, as intellectual and emotional beings, are meant to live in such an inflexible, neverending state of productivity and motivation. The second concept I hope to live by is &acirc;ÄúEmphasize strengths, don&acirc;Äôt fix weaknesses.&acirc;Äù I&acirc;Äôve never been great at sports. That is not to say I should stay away from those ever so exciting IM Volleyball game days. Perhaps it just means that I should prioritize my time and devote the majority of my resources toward my artistic and cerebral pursuits. The last concept I found especially relevant was &acirc;ÄúThe timing is never right.&acirc;Äù I don&acirc;Äôt want to be waiting forever for the perfect circumstances to come along. Right now at this point in life all I want to do is gain as much exposure to different industries and thought processes as possible. But instead of waiting for the right career or interest/opportunity to come along, I want to put all my energies into what I love right now. <br><br><br><span>Posted by <b>Grace Chen</b> on Tue, Sep 25 11:47:57 pm</span></div></div>

Many of us have different ideas in different forms. However, a network is what ties all these ideas together. Many entrepreneurs fear the fact that their ideas can be replicated or stolen, however, Steven Johnson sheds light on how a good network leads to the development of the idea and allows for further improvements. I feel that SEP mirrors this environment for me. SEP is essentially a network of people with similar interests and goals. Mine, for one, is making an impact in the world through innovation and invention. I feel that through being resourceful and making use of the network around me will further enhance my creativity and make entrepreneurship more than just the production of ideas but the creative execution of them.<br /><br />&quot;How to win friends and influence people&quot;<br /><br />I found this book valuable in how it teaches me to re-evaluate my position as a team leader and team member. This chapter emphasizes on how before we criticize and blame people for our failures or mishaps, we should look at ourselves first. In our life, we may face many conflicting ideas, criticism is sometimes inevitable, but this book shows us that in order to be a better team member and leader, we should criticize others us, and focus on self-betterment. In addition, in this day and age, we tend to complain a lot about many things. We find it easy to pinpoint others for our failures or to use others as scapegoats. This is evident in the book where prisoners tend to blame the institution rather than themselves for the position they are in. Not only does criticism create resentment, but it slows the progress of a team. I feel that before we put someone down and criticize them, we should re-evaluate our positions and come to a compromise. <br /><br />&quot;The 4 Hour Work Week&quot;<br /><br />I have actually read this book before and I found it really inspiring. This book is filled with examples of how Ferriss has been able to eliminate himself as the bottleneck in his company.  Can you imagine only responding to your emails on Monday morning &acirc;Äì and taking less than 30 minutes to do so?  Once you learn how to DEAL (Definition, Elimination, Automation, and Liberation), you can start living the life you want to live.  And profit from it. One of the most important aspects of this book is explaining the difference between being efficient and being effective.  Too often we focus on one at the cost of the other.  Ferriss provides excellent reasoning to help you decide when it&acirc;Äôs the right time to be effective or efficient. By following his technique, it is actually shocking how much time we can save. This book essentially teaches me how to outsource my life and not be afraid to follow my passions and create my own path, or rather, definition of success. <br /><br><br><br><span>Posted by <b>Alyssa Wee</b> on Tue, Sep 25 11:52:35 pm</span></div></div>

I also found it very useful when Mr. Johnson elucidated the common misconception that good ideas appear in &acirc;Äúflashes&acirc;Äù when in reality an idea is formed from a &acirc;Äúslow hunch&acirc;Äù (his example is Darwin and his Theory of Evolution).  Johnson also brings to light the example of the invention of the GPS from the observation of Sputnik to share the fact that an idea is slowly formed rather than instantaneously created.  The most important point made by Johnson in my opinion is the fact that good ideas tend to come into fruition from the contact and sharing of ideas with others.  Cooperation is vital for success.<br /><br />How to Win Friends and Influence People<br /> <br /> I thought this reading was overall interesting in that is was a reminder to remain humble and emotionally even keeled.  The main point of the reading was to not criticize others but instead look within yourself if a problem arises.  Examples described of the negative effects of criticizing/blaming others were the various gangsters in Sing Sing prison, Taft vs. Roosevelt, and the B.F. Skinner classical conditioning experiment.  The benefits of not criticizing other individuals in the text were the following&acirc;Äù Abraham Lincoln not sending an angry letter to his general, Hoover not getting angry that his mechanic made his plane malfunction, and the short poem Father Forgets by W. Livingston Larned (the message of which summarizes the entire reading in a very emotional way, I loved it).<br /><br />The 4 Hour Work Week<br /><br /> The 4 Hour Work Week chapters 1-2 readings were very interesting in that it made a distinction between time spent making money and time spent enjoying life (this distinction gets blurred: 500k vs. 50k with ample time to enjoy life).  I personally think this distinction is vitally important because many people look at the face value of a job (salary) and not the time commitment attached with it.  Another interesting point from the reading is the difference between Newly Rich (NR) and the Deferrers (D).  Although in my opinion the categorization of the two seems a bit clumsy, it is still a useful reminder for me to always stay on the side of the NRs (entrepreneurship is suppose to be fun, startup new things and after a while take a break to recharge and create a new project).  <br /><br /><br /><br><br><br><span>Posted by <b>John Lee</b> on Wed, Sep 26 02:00:40 am</span></div></div>
