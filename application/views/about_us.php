      <h2>Our Mission</h2><hr>
      <span>
        Sigma Eta Pi is dedicated to developing human potential. Our mission is to transform individuals into starters
      who follow their passion, develop lasting relationships with other starters, and create value through innovative
      pursuits.

      To facilitate individuals’ transformation and growth, our program offers a series of crucibles designed to push
      their limitations. We educate our brothers with the most comprehensive knowledge of the start-up ecosystem
      and venture processes, and equip them with a concrete set of skills sourced from the diverse backgrounds in
      house.

          <li id="1">How long is the Pledge process? What does it entail? <br><br> The Pledging process is 8 weeks. Our goal is to prepare our pledges mentally and physically to shape them into capable and confident individuals who can achieve their life-long goals. We bond our pledge class together internally and we integrate our pledges with the active house to develop a brotherhood to last us beyond college.</li><br><br>
          <li id="2">How are you different from an entrepreneurship club? <br><br> There are two factors: First, we are a fraternity. The strong bonds developed through the pledge
          process and maintained by the brotherhood translate well into entrepreneurship. Behind all
          great start-ups is a great team. Also, the level of commitment in a fraternity is much greater. Few
          clubs can boast the dedication and commitment of a fraternity. Second, no entrepreneurship
          organization at the undergraduate level has the talent, motivation, and resources to really make
          an impact. Our goals are not only to foster entrepreneurship at the undergraduate level but also to
          connect the entire campus in an effort to generate and execute great ideas.</li><br><br>
          <li id="3">If I'm not a business major, can I still join? <br><br> Absolutely, in fact, we welcome all majors to join. We want to build a close-knit class of
          undergraduates who come from different backgrounds with skill sets. We don't just want the
          business or economics majors; we want the scientists, architects, engineers, and graphic artists.
          No single person can possess all the resources and technical abilities to bring an idea into
          reality. This is the secret sauce for Sigma Eta Pi and crucial to creating great start-ups. With a
          diverse array of skills, knowledge, and perspective, we can execute ideas that require much beyond our
          personal abilities.</li><br><br>
          <li id="4">Do I have to be an entrepreneur? Do I have to have made start-ups? <br><br> No, you don't even have to have an idea. The fraternity was made to inspire and educate
          students who are interested in entrepreneurship, regardless of their major or experience. What's
          unique about SEP is that it's as much of a learning experience as it is an application. You can
          take what you learn and directly apply it to the project you are working on. Entrepreneurship is an
          applied science that can be prepared for, but cannot be fully understood without doing it.</li><br><br>
          <li id="5">How much time commitment should I expect? What might I be expected to do? <br><br> We expect you to commit an amount of time that requires you to make SEP and school your top
          priorities. We try to stimulate and encourage our Brothers’ creativity by presenting a wide variety
          of talks, keynote Speakers, presentations, and Think Tank sessions. We believe it is important
          that your mindset is constantly on entrepreneurship to gain the most through the pledge process.
          We will frequently stimulate your innovative thinking as you transition from being an ordinary
          student to being an extraordinary starter.</li><br><br>
